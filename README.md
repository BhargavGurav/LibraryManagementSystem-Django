# Library Management System Django
<h3>Library management system made usgin Django ( by me &#128513; ).</h3>
<p>It has one landing page from there you go to login page. Where admin (librarian) can login using credentials.</p>
<p>After login admin reach to the registration page where he/she can register students of college. After registration it is possible for admin to give book to students.These registration entries and book entries are shown on two different pages. Admin can sort the data on the basis of different aspects of table eg. Date of issue, name. These book entries can be deleted. Student details can be edited and can be deleted also.</p>
Pages in this Application
<ol>
<li>Landing page</li>
<li>Login Page</li>
<li>Student details page</li>
<li>Book issued Entries page</li>
</ol>

<p>I have used Bootstrap 5 and custome css for styling. I have used Modals to edit, register student and entry the book issuance details.</p>
